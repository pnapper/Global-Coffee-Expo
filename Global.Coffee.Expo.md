This past Sunday I attended the Global Specialty Coffee Expo for the first time. My business partner and I are opening a coffee shop in the coming months and thought it would be a great opportunity to explore the world of coffee, network with other professionals and coffee enthusiasts, and try many different coffees from all over the globe.

>As we entered what we thought to be the main exhibition hall we were overwhelmed by the amount of vendor booths, coffee and tea samples, and coffee brewing and roasting equipment. We made our way through sampling coffee from Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda and teas from Taiwan and Japan. We drooled over the latest espresso machines from Astoria, La Marzocco, Breville and others. I also tried my first Turkish coffee which I found to be a unique and enjoyable experience.

>We had heard about the barista competitions that were taking place and found that they were upstairs in a different hall. So we made our way there and were able to watch 2 competitors in each of the United States Cup Tasters Championship Final Round and the United States Barista Championship Final Round. We found it very interesting and also rather easy to mock the seriousness of the event. Not to take away anything from the skill and practice that goes into making it to the finals.

>My business partner ran into a friend who informed us that there was a whole other exhibition hall that was even larger that we hadn't made it to yet. We had about 2 hours left before things were going to shut down so we rushed across a skybridge to the hall. Again we were overwhelmed and made our way through skipping most of the samples as we were pretty wired on caffein already. We did discover a section called "Uppers and Downers" which featured several collaborations between beer brewers and coffee makers. We sampled several of the beers and found Georgetown Brewing's offering to be the best.

>Throughout the day we exchange information with water filtration companies, tea and coffee roasters, sign makers and packaging producers. There will be much to follow up on. We grabbed a great poster on our way out of a color wheel that represents the many flavor profiles of coffee. All in all it was an enlightening day.
